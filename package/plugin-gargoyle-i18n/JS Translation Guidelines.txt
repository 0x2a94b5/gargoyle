Internationalization lang.js Guidelines:

• All files are to be UTF-8 with BOM
• All object key/property pairs are to end with a '\n' newline; not '\r'
• body of each property is MAX 4096 bytes (not UTF-8 characters).
• A single translated.js file of strings is MAX 51200 bytes.

If you creating your own page & want to us internationalization:
  Use the form <%~ yourpagename.descriptive_key %>
  Note the space & the percentage sign. You cannot mix the older ? form with the newer anywhere on the page. Only the newer form is tested.
  yourpagename will be used as the basis of the javascipt Object. You can use: yourpagename.aproperty; Yourpagename.aproperty; yourpagenameStr.aproperty or YourpagenameStr.aproperty.
  Do not use spaces in the property key, or around the equal sign:
    minidlna.VFolder="Select a folder for video files"; // correct
    minidlna. VFolder = "Select a folder for video files" // wrong
  You can incorporate common elements (from strings.js) by just using the key: <%~ SaveChanges %>

Not Yet Determined:
• I think all whacked html/js characters ('&') are to be escaped?

TODO:
transition to var somename = new Object; to a stand-alone file in i18n/universal for each page & modify gargoyle_header_footer.
