Internationalization lang.js Guidelines:

• All files are to be UTF-8 with BOM
• Only the fallback language is to have 'var something New Object' declarations
• All object key/property pairs are to end with a '\n' newline; not '\r'
• file searches ignore the variable name, only the key is used (UI.Save & page.Save will only find the first occurrence)
• body of each property is MAX 4096 bytes (not UTF-8 characters).
• A single translated.js file of strings is MAX 51200 bytes.

Not Yet Determined:
• I think all whacked html/js characters ('&') are to be escaped?
