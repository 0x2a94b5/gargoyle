Internationalization lang.js Guidelines:

• All files are to be UTF-8 with BOM (Byte Order Mark)
• All object key/property pairs are to end with a '\n' newline; not '\r'
• body of each property is MAX 4096 bytes (not UTF-8 characters).
• A single translated.js file of strings is MAX 51200 bytes.

If you are creating your own page & want to use internationalization:
  - Use the form <%~ yourpagename.descriptive_key %> for the first instance in the haserl yourpage.sh page.
  - Note the space & the percentage sign. You cannot mix the older <? ?> form with the newer anywhere on the page. Only the newer form is tested.
  - yourpagename.js will be sourced as the translation file. In the haserl pages, only the first instance of the page used need be present. Subsequent (2nd, 3rd, 100th) instances can skip the full <%~ yourpagename.descritive_key %> form to the shorter <%~ descritive_key %> form.
  - The javascript variable in yourpagename.js is used only inside javascript. In haserl parsing, the variable must be present, but only the key is used. For javascript, a distinctive variable should be used. In javascript the 'key' is called a property.
  - The keys must be unique across the files. Typically, only the strings.js & the active page have keys loaded. The haserl <% key %> does not distinguish between UI.Close & somepage.Close - the final Close is the text that will be used. Using unique keys prevents this behavior.
  - Do not use spaces in the property key, or around the equal sign:
      minidlna.VFolder="Select a folder for video files"; // correct
      minidlna. VFolder = "Select a folder for video files" // wrong
  - You can incorporate common elements (from strings.js) by just using the key: <%~ SaveChanges %> as strings.js will always be loaded.
  - If you use these characters in your translation, they need to be escaped to the corresponding sequence below:
	&	<	>	"	'
	&amp;	&lt;	&gt;	&quot;	&apos;

---------------------------
To see if you have duplicate keys a translation file (this does not work across strings.js & yourpage.js):
awk -F '=' '{ print $1 }' /path/to/yourpage.js | uniq -d
