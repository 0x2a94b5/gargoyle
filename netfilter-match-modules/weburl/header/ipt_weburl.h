/*  weburl --	A netfilter module to match URLs in HTTP requests 
 *  		This module can match using string match or regular expressions
 *  		Originally designed for use with Gargoyle router firmware (gargoyle-router.com)
 *
 * 		Note that this module relies on the regex library included with layer7 module
 * 		be sure to have the source for layer7 match support (even if you don't build it)
 * 		otherwise you'll get errors if you try to build weburl
